        The map was developed using Excel/Google Sheets. Each cell was filled
        with a certain value. Through conditional formatting, the color of the
        cell changed afterwards, so you could always see what Excel looked like
        in real time. The Excel was then exported in CSV format.

                will contain a coin at start. The coins are generated newly each
